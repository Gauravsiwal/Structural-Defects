use {rep_title} as title, {prep_by} as prepared by, {prep_for} as prepred for the same.
Also mention the current date from {dt.datetime.now().date()}.

* Identify and classify the defect for eg: crack, spalling, corrosion, honeycombing, etc.
* There could more than one defects in the image. Identify all the defects seperately.
* For each defect identified, provide a short description of the defect and its potential impact on the structure.
* For each measure the severity of the defect as low, medium or high. Also mention if the defect is inevitable or avoidable.
* Also mention the time before this defect leads to permament damage to the structure.
* provide a shot term and long solution anlong with their estimated cost (in INR) and time to implement.
* What precuationary measures can be taken to avoid such defects in future.
* The report generated should be in the word format.
